# WSCXR

**ðŸ’¡ This is the official implementation of the paper "Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection for Chest X-Ray Image"**.  


WSCXR is a weakly supervised anomaly detection framework for Chest X-Ray (CXR) image. WSCXR can effectively leverage medical cues from few-shot real anomalous images for anomaly detection, thereby improving the modelâ€™s anomaly detection performance. Additionally, WSCXR employs a linear mixing strategy to augment the anomaly features, facilitating the training of anomaly detector with few-shot anomaly images.
